## Description

Server Name Indication (SNI) is a mechanism in the TLS protocol in which a TLS
client indicates at the beginning of the handshake which hostname it is
connecting to.

## Uses

Servers can use this information to choose which certificate to send to the
client. This is needed because servers may have more than one certificate, for
example a server may have two certificates: one for irc.example.net and another
one for server.example.net. In this scenario, when a client connects the server
has no way of knowing which certificate to offer because it does not know at the
time of the handshake which hostname the client is using.

SNI fixes this problem by sending the hostname to the server early, so the
server can choose the certificate corresponding to the hostname the client is
using.

## Requirements

Clients MUST use SNI when connecting to servers via TLS. (This implies that a TLS
version capable of SNI, i.e. at least TLS 1.1, is required.)
